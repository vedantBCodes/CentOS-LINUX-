#Soft link and Hard link

#Links:Links are nothing but a connection between a file name and the actual content of file
       We can call it as a shortcut


#Soft link :A soft link is similar to the file shortcut feature which is used in Windows Operating                                  
           system.
           One can create a softlink of a nested file and can call that file using that link (next time ).Softlink will be removed as soon as original file is deleted .

Syntax to create a softlink : $ ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 
          

[vedant@localhost ~]$ mkdir -p folderx/foldery/folderz

Here 3 folders are created which are nested inside one another 


[vedant@localhost ~]$ touch folderx/foldery/folderz/file1.txt

Here a file is created inside the innermost folder (folders)


[vedant@localhost ~]$ cat > folderx/foldery/folderz/file1.txt 
hii its file1.txt.
how are you guys.
Hope you are good.
^C

Here some text is added inside that file using cat command

Now we are creating a softlink of that created file

[vedant@localhost ~]$ ln -s folderx/foldery/folderz/file1.txt file1

Here we gave soft link name as file1
Now we can display the content of a file using that link

[vedant@localhost ~]$ cat file1
hii its file1.txt.
how are you guys.
Hope you are good.



#Hard link:Hard link is like a copy of original file .Renaming,deleting or removing file will not affect the hard link.


Syntax to create a hardlink : $ ln  [original filename] [link name] 

[vedant@localhost ~]$ ln folderx/foldery/folderz/file1.txt file1h

Here we gave hard link name as file1h
Now we can display the content of a file using that link

[vedant@localhost ~]$ cat file1h
hii its file1.txt.
how are you guys.
Hope you are good.
[vedant@localhost ~]$
